  - Fabric:  securely connected set of interacting services which
    provide the foundation for the Sinon Semantics

  - Fabrik Keys: private/public key pair used to identify and secure
    all management communication.  Is created by the first component
    instance, i.e. the application.  It needs to be persistently
    stored by the user in order to reconnect to the fabric.  The
    private ID (or its hash) can thus operate as a fabric ID.

    As the Fabric will passes private keys to distributed components,
    it should never reuse a user's ssh keypairs!


  - Session: a set of interrelated operations on the Sinon Fabric
    which use the Sinon semantics for a specific, well defined (set
    of) application instances, i.e. for a specific set of interrelated
    resource overlays (pilots).  A session ID will accompany all
    service interactions.  A service will only accept requests for
    registered services -- registering/de-registering session keys is
    a fabric management method.


  - Registry: a fabric component which is presumably fail safe and
    persistent.  It is always started as first fabric component, and
    its access information are passed around the fabric on new
    component instantiations.
